# World Bond/Stock(WBS) Portfolio

Constructing the WBS portfolio from 4 Vanguard ETFs: VTI(US Equity), VXUS(International Equity), BND(US Bond), and BNDX(International Bond). To find market cap data, I scrape index reports from the providers of the indices that the ETFs track. I also scrape current prices for the ETFs from yahoo finance.

Left over cash (if any) is invested into VTIP(Short-Term Inflation-Protected Securities).

Motivation behind this portfolio comes from my FIN 494: Portfolio Engineering class and William Sharpe.
